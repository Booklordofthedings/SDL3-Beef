# SDL3-Beef

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1631c909-4b51-49b8-92d2-e0aa6414bb25)

This project provides a binding for the SDL3 library to the Beef programming language.  
It provides one primary binding that aims to be as close as possible to the original library in the `SDL3.Raw` namespace,
while potentially also providing a more structured interface in the future.
